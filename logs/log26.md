## Overview

Pitched at the Civil War Museum, presented to the Newseum

## Development

Omar added laserpointer, begand documentation, will start simplifying experience and focus on optimizing for a pop-up exhibit experience.

Need to make new story map.

Decisions will be made in a seperate level, give time to think about options. Also choices need to be facing one direction, consistent every time.

## Business

Came up with plan for what Exemplum studios is, potential pathways

We area a sort of "one stop shop" for compelling VR experiences, providing software, hardware and service for institutions. Could go to (a) museums/cultural institutions (b) charity organizations/fundraisers/churches? (c) universities.

For museums, important things I've learned: pop-up exhibits are good for selling memberships, staffing is a huge issue, it should work outdoors, make sure older people can use it, think about how groups would interact (monitor helps a lot), selfie opportunities are 10/10 A+ dope as heck.

## Outreach

Got in touch with Phillipe about Philadelphia Museum
Spoke with Scott Barclay
Reached out to Jay Lester

Need a report for each potential customer, i.e. (1) for aid organizations, (2) for museums/cultural institutions, (3) universities.

Need to touch base with the library system.Need to touch base with the library system.
