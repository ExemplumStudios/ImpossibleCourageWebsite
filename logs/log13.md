## Overview

My team and I have made a lot of progress adding functionality to the VR experience, including working animations for the hands, early ocean simulation, and prototype decision/interaction actors. The review was okay but no new feedback. I also have some responses from the Internal Review Board for Social and Behavioral Sciences (IRB SBS), 

## Development

Added more static meshes to the first scene
Tried basic cloth simulations, got APEX cloth working (somewhat)
Fully functional state machines for different hand animations, including grip, idle and point.

Had to build a VR pawn out of Blueprint while we worked on fixing crashing from the coded version. I also experimented a lot with collision objects.

## Testing

Completed CITI training, so I can now submit protocols to the IRB.
A member of IRB has responded, need to provide more specifics.

## Exhibit

Complete draft of digital logo design, unifying theme of a red door.

Planning on starting prototyping for exhibit panel designs, including the newsprint look. I also need to make some modifications to the design…could it be metal? How am I going to get bolt holes through the joinery?

## Funding

Meeting with Ryan, the iLab law student, next week.

## Outreach

Talked with Chic Thompson, former Disney employee that is working on a project called WAGI Labs. He has offered to give feedback on how effective the project is, and show it to a museum’s board this week.

Here is some of the follow up work I still have to do:
Send Info/Materials to Chic
Update Kirsten Gelsdorf
Introduce Yourself to Sandra
Update Kristin Gutekunst
Follow Up with Charlotte/Alexandra

Also, Mona Kasra wants a packaged and polished version of the animation prototype to send to exhibitions.
