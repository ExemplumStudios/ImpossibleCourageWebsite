## Overview

We had out first exhibition in the iLab. I also began planning ways of distributing Impossible Courage, and talking to potential organizations that could use this.

## Development

Began creating full bug/feature list and started planning a few more interesting features. Omar is working on potentially creating/populating levels procedurally from a library of objects (based on notes within a framework, written by Claire). Connor is taking a look at underwater scenes and volumetric materials (for better clouds/storms).

## Exhibit

Set up in iLab

Meeting and talking with Katherine, did "exhibit" work for iLab at SxSW

Contacted exhibit designer at Civil War Museum

## Business

Basically, there are two goals I need to reach by the end of iLab. *First,* we need to have a polished and impactful product, Impossible Courage, that can be used as a basis for a Kickstarter Campaign. *Second,* we need to have talked to enough potential users to know our product is needed (i.e. United Nations, MSF, IRC, Newseum, UVA Library, and other non-profits, museums, and educational institutions).

## Outreach

Met with Brendan, potential Mentor

Reached out to Kevin of Contraline, could help find funding
