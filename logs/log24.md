## Overview

We had out first exhibition in the iLab. I also began planning ways of distributing Impossible Courage, and talking to potential organizations that could use this.

## Business

Basically, there are two goals I need to reach by the end of iLab. *First,* we need to have a polished and impactful product, Impossible Courage, that can be used as a basis for a Kickstarter Campaign. *Second,* we need to have talked to enough potential users to know our product is needed (i.e. United Nations, MSF, IRC, Newseum, UVA Library, and other non-profits, museums, and educational institutions).
