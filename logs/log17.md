## Overview

We've decided that virtual reality is just a fad, and no longer viable. Instead, we're focusing on baking and distributing high quality strawberry rhubarb pies.

April Fools! If you fell for that, I admire your faith in us and respect your belief in strawberry rhubarb pies as a timeless investment opportunity.

This week had a few major developments. First, we have a prototype website using some sweet jQuery effects. Second, we finalized a development plan for rolling out the first full beta. And third, the Impossible Courage pilot study was approved by the IRB-SBS.

## Development

We divided the next stage of development into three major parts, level design, choice UI and animation. Completing these should produce a usable beta. From there, we are going to add sound and polish the UI/timing/gameplay. Then we can add more stories with different environments and pathways.

Here’s the breakdown:

*Level Design*

Atthar:
Keep grinding with the mesh conversion,
Create all level placeholder

Connor:
Finish the coloring work on the ocean,
Figure out the rain/storm,
Move everything we need into our level placeholders

*Choice UI*

Omar:
Having a “point” decision object made,
Get the question/decision actors working with the level,
Level load,
Question & Choices Load,
Consequences load based on pointing,
Trigger Timer,
Trigger level switch (using trackpad),
Make the text rotate to face the player,
Try to get the text to fade in

Connor:
Learn UMG in order to get timer UI working

Collin:
Introduce item spawning based on what you were holding in the last level

*Animation*

Collin:
Working on getting weights to look right with teddy bear
Get people floating in water

## Testing

I got approval for the pre/post survey trials from the Internal Review Board for Social and Behavioral Sciences. I’m going to finish designing materials for use in the trials next week, and begin testing in mid-April.

I also created a brief post survey to try with students. The results so far are very promising. I’ve started recording them in a spreadsheet.

## Exhibit

I have developed new designs for the exhibit panels, ones that should function a little better than my current version.

Funding/Business

Should be hearing from Ryan soon about finalizing an operating agreement.

## Outreach

Claire managed to talk to a former refugee from Jordan, she’s working with this person to develop a story database that we can draw from for future timelines in Impossible Courage.
