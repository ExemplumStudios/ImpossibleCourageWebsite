<p><b>Hello, World!</b></p>

<p>Welcome to the development log.</p>

<p>This is a little less technical version of the patch notes, where I describe the latest progress in developing the "Impossible Courage" VR Experience. It's an effort to be transparent, and to share with all of you the care and thought that goes into handling such a delicate project.</p>

<p>In the following pages, you'll find technical details, milestones, notes from me, mentions of a whole host of people involved, and maybe even a little humor. I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Atthar Mirza, Creative Director at Exemplum Studios</p>
