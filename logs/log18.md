## Overview

This was a relatively slow week, I was distracted by other responsibilities. The highlights include continued progress on preparing for VR trials, and a finished/polished website.

## Development

Made some progress on finalizing the truncated, “gallery” version of Impossible Courage. I have now planned out all the changes that need to be made, and begun creating the modified Blender scenes.

I need to keep making progress on moving meshes into Unreal Engine, for now I created placeholder levels that Connor can start populating with oceans.

## Testing

I have finished designing the pre/post surveys. Next steps are to figure out the most efficient way to measure head angle throughout the trial, and also begin recruiting for it.

## Exhibit

Nothing new here, focused on VR development until April 22nd.

## Funding/Business

Ryan is waiting on getting the operating agreement approved by the supervising attorney. Meeting with him next week to incorporate Exemplum Studios.

## Outreach

Working on setting up meetings with former refugees and immigrants from all around the world. Hopefully we can learn lots from them.

Also, the website is finalized. It not has interactive charts reading directly from .csv file, which gives me loads of flexibility. Now that I’ve done it once, I can do it as many times as I need from
