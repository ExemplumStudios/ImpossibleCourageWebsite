## Overview

I just presented the project so far at my mid-review yesterday. It went really well, but I also have a lot of feedback and new ideas to incorporate into my project. Also, the Concept Brief for "Over a Refugee’s Shoulders" was submitted Thursday night. Hopefully, we receive some funding! Finally, one of my reviewers is from the Nursing School at UVA and has connections at MSF. He is willing to work with me on a brief to submit to his colleagues. That’s the biggest news, now let’s get into it.

## Development

I received a lot of feedback to guide future development during the mid-review. My team for the E-Cup also made it down to the review, and had both comments and notes to add to what I wrote. I’m going to attempt to consolidate every criticism into this section of the log.

Some of the broader and bigger feedback included being very deliberate about my methodology behind the project and distribution. This included keeping one of the 10 humanitarian mandates in mind, “any image should show people in their best light.” This ties into a careful balancing act between representing refugees without discrimination/bias and risking making the men and women even more of an “other.” I also need to think about how I’m going to infiltrate mainstream society, could I potentially partner with National Geographic, New York Times, or movie theaters, etc. Finally, I need to make sure the viewer is immersed in the experience and feeling something. Right now, it can feel like you’re in the scenes as an observer, rather than suffering through the events as a refugee would be. Adding little points of emotional connection, such as dogs being left behind as you enter a refugee camp, could add a level of connection and emotion.

As far as technical feedback, I got some specific pointers. One of the professors commented on my ocean simulation, saying I should look into data from the Mediterranean to make it more realistic. He also said to add more people to the boat, it didn’t feel as claustrophobic as it should. Other development feedback includes somehow including real photos and news reports into the animation. I could add them using some sort of 360º photo-joiner. I also might need to add some color. Mona Kasra likes the look right now, but I think it could be powerful if it was closer to reality. Someone pointed out that more dramatic lighting could help a lot too. John Timpone, at Edovo, and a few other people say to add animation to the people. It’ll be a lot of work, but maybe I can add slight movements. John also says to add a voice of a baby crying in the boat, and to add explosions and smoke in the distance in the Libya scene. Finally, he said I need to be careful of adding too much detail, I don’t want people to debate whether the game is realistic or not.

## Research

There hasn’t been a whole lot of additional research done. I did make plans to meet with more professors, though. Right now I’m just looking and studying precedents I already have.

## Funding

After a lot of work, the Entrepreneurship Cup brief was submitted.
