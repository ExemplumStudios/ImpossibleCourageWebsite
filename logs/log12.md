## Overview

I’ve got a review coming up Monday, so this week has been an opportunity to get organized. I’ve got a fine

## Development

Finished the entire storyboard for Impossible Courage and planned out all choices.
Re-modeled the base refugee, with better geometry on the hand and less polygons. I’ve got clean UVs and a baked AO texture.
Omar has made progress on the UML mapping and has gotten a base for the decision actor working. Also, objects are now pick-up-able. They use the grip buttons.

## Exhibit

I have a final design language for the logo, just need to make it digital now.

I made the first panel for the Fire at Sea screening, and it turned out really well. The panel has a rotatable frame (for different posters) and bolts (so it can be dis-assembled). Lucia gave the idea of a newspaper aesthetic, it looks like a bulletin board.

## Funding

The AZAwards submission is in.

I had a mixer with some law students for the iLab.

## Outreach

Claire was able to get in touch with the Family Medicine people, they might be able to share insights.

Met with Sara and some grad students about potentially setting up an in-depth experiment to send to the UN.

Talking with Chic Thompson, former executive at Disney, about my project this week.
