## Overview

The biggest news this week is an update on the Entrepreneurship Cup. We made it past the first part of round 1, meaning out concept brief received a high enough score to enter us into pitch night. Next week Thursday, November 10th, Team Immersive will be pitching Over a Refugee’s Shoulders to a bunch of people and competing for $1000. Also of note, I presented this project to a large audience after the showing of Fire at Sea at the Virginia Film Festival.

## Development

The next steps in development are to build out newer scenes. These should reflect feedback to add emotional beats to the experience. The first scene I’ve started working on is the interior of the refugee boy’s apartment.

Also, I’ve decided to build an exhibition to test Over a Refugee’s Shoulders in the same place as Cru. I need a way for people to sit and view the VR experience, though. So I’m going to use the concrete bench thing in Newcomb Plaza. I’m still in the planning phase.

## Research

I did two main types of precedent research this week. I downloaded and used UNVR to see how the international organization was approaching this new medium. They have several 3D 360º videos about refugees. Second, Nonny de la Peña’s Project Syria is on Steam. I was able to try it out at this week’s UVA Immersive meeting. The experience is impressive, but also short and low quality. Despite being free, the experience has gotten 100% negative reviews on Steam. I need to make sure I do everything I can to avoid a reaction like this.

## Outreach

Presenting at the Virginia Film Festival (VFF) was an amazing experience. I was the first to go out of around 5 students, and we got to answer questions from the audience afterward. I stayed behind in the lobby to receive audience members who wanted to see the VR experience for themselves. People were blown away. 

## Funding

We had our first fellowship meeting this week, and to be honest it was pretty uneventful. I was a little late, which wasn’t great, but I didn’t miss much. We talked a little bit about where we’d be meeting, what to expect, and who the advisors/mentors were.

And last but not least, my team and I have begun preparation for Pitch Night! They didn’t give us a lot of notice, which is what it is so I can’t complain. I’ve started making a slide deck. It’s my first time pitching a business, and I’m pretty nervous.
