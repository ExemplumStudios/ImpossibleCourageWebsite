## Overview

Three major things happened this week. First, “Ideal” (Tori’s venture making jackets) and “Team Immersive” (my team developing Over a Refugee’s Shoulders) both won $1000 at the first round of the Entrepreneurship Cup. Second, I was selected to go on to the Student Speaker Competition for TEDxUVA. And finally, Deborah Park and I drove up to Philadelphia yesterday to go see Forced from Home and it was one of the most useful and eye-opening experiences in this project thus far. So, lot’s to talk about!
