# 25 March 2017

## Overview

The biggest development this week was finishing the trailer for the animated version of Impossible Courage. So overall, a pretty slow week.

## Development

Omar has the HTC Vive now, we’re working on fixing the decision and interact actors.

I’ve decided to block out all the levels we’ll need before doing any more finishing work. I really have to finish doing this ASAP, holding the rest of the project back at this point. And VR with water is going to be an interesting challenge.

## Testing

Still haven’t heard back from the IRC.

## Exhibit

Finished a scale model of the exhibit, with proportional silhouettes. It gave me an idea about how to design the panels.

I made a note of including disabled people, child-carrying mothers and toddlers in the silhouettes. This should help ensure the exhibit is accessible.

I have to navigate copyright issues for images. Or I could go with an “educational use only” clause, and then make a new version at the iLab.

## Funding/Business

I sent a finished executive summary to Ryan. Here is what I sent:

Exemplum Studios seeks to tell real stories in new, engaging ways in order to move people into action. We are a forward thinking group, excited and optimistic about emerging technologies and their potential for garnering empathy. Our storytelling techniques employ digital modeling, animation, web development, game engines and programming, virtual reality hardware and more. The studio’s first project, entitled Impossible Courage, takes advantage of the HTC Vive and Unreal Engine 4 to tell the stories of refugees. It was founded in 2017 by Atthar Mirza, Omar El-Sheikh, Connor Anderson, Collin Hansen and Claire Poumerol.

## Outreach

Met with refugees at an IRC sponsored dialogue. It was super helpful.

Going to be meeting with a local journalist, Jordy Yager, about telling refugee stories.
