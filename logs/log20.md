## Overview

This was a huge week for development. We got all the major systems working, and put together a brief demo for presentation. I also planned and got materials for the final exhibit panels. Finally, we had successful week of testing, with 15 participants and detailed data from each.

## Development/Exhibit

For the development side, a few major things happened. First, we got the level change system working properly. Omar programmed in some ray-casting from the controllers, so that you can trigger decision actors by simply pointing. He also changed it so that if you’re pointing, the consequence text visibility gets triggered (you don’t have to point and click a button). Also, clicking on the button while pointing loads the next level.

Second, I added a few more meshes and began fleshing out both the fixed and destroyed apartment scenes. I also added the most important meshes for the detention center, added idle animations to the main character’s skeleton, and did some more texture baking/UV unwrapping for existing meshes.

Third, Collin added constraints and collision objects to the character skeleton, making successful rag-doll physics. This should allow people to float realistically in the ocean. Understanding of the physics system will also allow us to add things like hanging dynamic lights and APEX cloth simulation.

Fourth, Connor has the oceans looking incredible in black and white. The ocean is also working properly with the boats, including the ability to control forward movement and a technique for reducing clipping.

For the exhibit: bought materials

## Testing

Successful trials
Difficulty with recording sensor data
Happened over three days, in the digital media lab

Collin helped, did detailed recordings of viewing angle

## Funding/Business

Continued work on operating agreement, stepped ownership model.
Fellowship presentation, went well
