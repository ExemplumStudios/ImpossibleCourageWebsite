## Overview

Met with Abdul Al Halabi, a business lead from Nvidia. This was my email to Kirsten, good summary (forgot to include iLab stuff):

Professor Gelsdorf,

I haven't touched base with you in a while, so I thought I'd update you on progress so far! I've divided my thesis into 4 main parts (and a miscellaneous one for outreach/funding/feedback etc.), here they are:

## Development

I have a brand new GTX 1080 to start working with, and potentially a job at Nvidia.

I'm working on bringing the project into Unreal Engine to add functionality for a fully featured VR headset like the HTC Vive. Here's a demo clip of it at work: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxW6wXOrqVdqZ2prOUhFSklYdEk.

I'm also working on packaging and polishing the 3D 360 Animation I showed you last semester. Another advisor wants me to send it to galleries and events where a fully interactive experience isn't as desirable.

Finally, I made a diagram outlining most of my research, the different scenes in the final version of Impossible Courage, and the choices a user will make as they navigate the experience. The diagram is attached (it's kind of a large file, sorry in advance).

## Testing

I have submitted a proposal to the IRB-SBS (with Professor Tim Cunningham's help) to conduct a brief pilot study of the experience. I have heard back from them, and am revising the documents a little to address their concerns.

I was also approached by some graduate students in Sophie Trawalter's class! They want to use my animated experience to conduct a more in-depth study. Sara Medina-DeVilliers was the student that emailed me.

## Writing

I'm working on a detailed draft outline of my thesis to send out for feedback.

In the mean time, to present part of my research, I made a diagram showing pretty much everyone I have spoken to and some notes on what I learned. The diagram is attached.

## Exhibit

The final presentation for this project is going to be an exhibit! I have constructed a prototype 6' x 2' panel for mounting information. There are going to be several panels surrounding the VR tracking area. The exhibit is going to be show in Campbell Hall for my final thesis review, and in the Fine Arts Library for my Digital Arts Fellowship Review. Do you have any ideas on other places it should be shown?

## Funding

I met with Ryan from the iLab, we are working on an operating agreement and executive summary (I need to send hime one)

## Miscellaneous

I gave a TEDx talk! If you have time to watch it, you can find it here: https://livestream.com/tavco/tedxuva2017/videos/149166224 (mine starts at about 2:33:00). If you'd like me to give a slimmed down version of this to your class, I'd be more than happy to.

I have been speaking with Charlotte and Alexandra at UN OCHA and they have given me tons of encouragement and advice. They also connected me with Kristen Gutekunst of the SDG Action Campaign, and she also gave some valuable advice. I can't thank you enough for putting me in touch with them!

Finally, I'm attaching the latest version of the overview for the project.

I recognize this is a massive email, I hope it isn't too much at once! I tried to bold the super important stuff. Thanks for all your help thus far, and looking forward to hearing from you soon.
