<p><b>15 October 2016</b></p>

<p>The biggest news this week was the successful procurement of starting funds! I received the Digital Arts Fellowship to develop this project. I also have an opportunity to present the final experience at a meeting around the end of May.</p>

<p><b>Development</b></p>

<p>The biggest “development” has been finishing a full, 2 minute version of the animation. I added a VR map with a path showing the journey you’re witnessing. This is very effective in tying the three scenes together. It could also be a good mechanic for picking scenes in the finished version. Some of the feedback I’ve gotten on the map has been 1) it doesn’t register that it’s a map, you need more time, 2) it would be awesome if the map was a table with little figurines for the animation and 3) there isn’t enough time or high-enough resolution to see what’s written on the map. I’ve also gotten feedback on the first scene in Libya. Right now, it doesn’t make sense that you’re standing in the middle of the road. It was suggested that I move the point of view to inside a building or a balcony. That would make the scene much more emotional and effective, as well as show what people are leaving behind. I was also told to make the final scene, the one in the refugee center at Lampedusa, more dynamic somehow. I have no idea how to do this, maybe make the camera move around so that you’re walking around (but then I need to re-consider the refugees being statues).</p>

<p>The second major stride is the addition of full sound design to the animation. It makes a huge difference. I added a scene with a storm, and the lightning and rain sounds feel incredible. Someone let me try the animation with sound cancelling headphones and that brought the experience to an entirely knew level. I’ve gotten feedback on the sounds as well. It includes: 1) the tank needs to sound heavier and more like a tank, 2) their should be sounds of the baby crying in the boat scene, 3) the boat motor should turn off for portions of the ocean scene and 4) there should be more people on the boat.</p>

<p>The next step in development is to add shading to the scenes. The most challenging shader is going to be the ocean, I tried playing around with a combination of glossy and translucent shaders and was very unsuccessful. I need good environment HDR images to really make the ocean pop, and I think I have some but I might need to paint a few in photoshop. I played some more of the Witness (mostly for inspiration, I promise), I want my animation to look like that game.</p>

<p>I also want to add some more scenes as well, maybe one in the water waiting for a rescue and one in the boat graveyard. Both could be incredibly powerful.</p>

<p><b>Research</b></p>

<p>I have gotten in touch with Doctors Without Borders to learn more about “Forced from Home.” This is an exhibit that is trying to accomplish almost exactly what I am, also using immersive technology. MSF has put on a traveling exhibition that includes a planetarium-esc presentation of 360 videos from refugee camps, etc., a series of props and exhibits of refugee living conditions, and finally GearVR viewers for 360 videos from MSF missions. The experience has gotten a lot of positive feedback, and I want to learn how they accomplished what they have managed to accomplish. I called and emailed the media person behind Forced from Home, and she has linked me with the exhibition director. I am going to follow up with them and see if I can learn more about the exhibit.</p>

<p>I also watched a TED talk from Nonny de la Peña, a VR journalist (the first of her kind) who has created incredibly moving pieces. These include “Hunger in LA” which premiered at Sundance. She is now working on a project about Syrian refugees. Nonny said she has seen people have visceral emotional responses to her work, even had people take off the headset with tears streaming down their cheeks. I can definitely achieve the visual fidelity she has with her exhibitions. I still need to get in touch with her to find out more, and maybe even collaborate.</p>

<p>The NYTimes has released a major VR initiative, with 360 videos coming from all over the world. These include a series of videos about the Libyan Army outside Sirte, where they are attempting to reclaim the city from ISIS.</p>

<p><b>Funding</b></p>

<p>Besides the Arts Fellowship, the team and I have made progress on the E-Cup concept brief.</p>
