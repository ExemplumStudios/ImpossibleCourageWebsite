## Overview

This was a big week for development, and taking steps towards incorporating the business. Oh, and we potentially changed our name from “Team Immersive” to “Exemplum Studios.”w

## Development

Cleaned up organization for future code
We were running into trouble with class naming, and automatically spawning player pawns. We also couldn’t quite get C++ classes and Blueprint to mesh correctly, I was overwriting methods on accident and certain methods weren’t available.

We fixed the naming conventions and collecting junk by getting rid of all “tests” and then rebuilding a blueprint class for the VR_Pawn from the C++ class. And then, we created a new GameMode Base and directed it to spawn the correct, Blueprint pawn.

Connor has made progress with the ocean, it looks awesome in VR. The next steps are figuring out how to connect skeletal meshes to the buoyancy actors (which are static) and figuring out why there’s weird snow falling. After that, we gotta get the look of the ocean to mesh with the rest of the experience’s style.

On my end, I need to finish level design for a lot of scenes, really soon. We need to get a choice UI up and functioning, so we can start filling that out.

## Testing

Finalizing the IRB protocol. We had to be a little more specific about how many people we were contacting/if we’re qualified to 

## Exhibit

Finished a scale model of the exhibit panels, and early drafts of the panel content.

The logo needs to have a door that is ajar or open (because it represents the goal of Impossible Courage better).

Planned exhibition space for the Digital Arts Fellowship, I’m going to be in the R-Lab.

Funding/Business

Had a meeting with the team about what to incorporate as and how to divide up ownership. It was intense but productive.

## Outreach

Attended the Works in Progress “Lighthouse” opening, it’s a collaborative space for student ventures.
