4,4,The beginning with the house bomb plunged me into the experience right away and the google cardboard experience put me right into the situation.,At one scene  (I think the refugee camp?) there was a black circle if you swivel around - idk if you can fix that though.,Complete, ,"1-5, Count",1,4,7,9,2,

4,4,Color scheme is effective…<3 the lack of color,I would love to see this further w/ a storyline,Incomplete,,,,,,,,
3,2,It's always helpful to have a more personal perspective of an event. The color white was more effective for me on the boat than the city. The city being white felt more like a video game.,N/A,Incomplete,,,,,,,,

4,4,Definitely helps put the viewer in the refugee's shoes.,Very creative..,Incomplete,,,,,,,,
3,3,I think that it would ellicit more of a response if it came with a story. Just seeing the situation I was slightly confused. Maybe having associated smells? A back story.,N/A,Incomplete,,,,,,,,
4,3,"Color would help. I think to get an emotional response you need it to feel really lifelike, and color would go a long way.",Adding people and action would also make for a more visceral reaction.,Incomplete,,,,,,,,

4,2,N/A,I would recommend less contrast for night scenes on the boat. The most sea sick I have ever been was @ night pitch dark unable to find any horizon. Creates an empathy for sure.,Incomplete,,,,,,,,
